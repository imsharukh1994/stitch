/** A Group is used as a key to batch calls together; calls with the
 * same (i.e. equals()) group may be batched together. Typically a
 * Group is a case class to get structural equality.
 *
 * For batch RPC APIs following the typical pattern of a set of keys
 * and some context which applies to all keys, the group should
 * include the context. For APIs with no context, the group can be
 * any distinct object.
 *
 * A group provides a runner to run calls in the group, so it can
 * pass the context to the underlying RPC call where needed.
